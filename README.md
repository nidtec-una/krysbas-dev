# [KRYSBAS](https://github.com/nidtec-una/krysbas-dev)
A repository for KRYlov Basic Adaptive Solvers for Sparse Linear Systems. Developed at the [Scientific Computing and Applied Mathematics](https://nidtec.pol.una.py/ccyma/) group at the [NIDTEC](https://nidtec.pol.una.py/) research center of the **Polytechnic Faculty at National University of Asunci√≥n, Paraguay**.

## **Introduction**
The main goal of this library is to propose control strategies for Krylov Subspace iterative methods, which is supported on new paradigms of computational architectures aiming at their stability, robustness and speed. Two types of algorithms will be considered:

* those that present the best efficiency for defined positive symmetric systems, and
* those that present better efficiency for general systems, possibly indefinite and poorly conditioned.

This repository is also intended to explore applications to real-world problems.

### **Krylov Subspace Methods**
The $r$th-order [Krylov Subspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krylov_subspace) generated by a $n$-by-$n$ matrix $A$ and a vector $b$ of dimension $n$ is the linear subspace spanned by matrix-vector multiplications between the powers of $A$ and the vector $b$.

$$ \mathcal{K}_r(A,b) = \text{span} \lbrace b, Ab, A^2b, \ldots, A^{r-1}b \rbrace $$

## **Generalized minimal residual method (GMRES)**
The [GMRES($m$)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_minimal_residual_method) method approximates the solution to the linear system $Ax=b$ at the $j$-th restart cycle using the previous residual, $r_{j-1}=b-Ax_{j-1}$, by constructing a $m$th-order Krylov subspace. The $j$-th approximation is built as:

```math
x_{j} = x_{j-1} + \mathcal{K}_{m} (A,r_{j-1})
```

where the index $m$ denotes that the restarting parameter was set to the value $m$. GMRES($m$) obtains an approximate solution which minimizes the $2$-norm of the residual $r_j$, i.e.,

```math
\min_{x_{j}\in x_{j-1} + \mathcal{K}_{m} (A,r_{j-1})}   \parallel b-Ax_{j} \parallel. $$
